  <p> Who are we? Well, we're the Big Bang Gang of course! We are a group of people with theoretical degrees in physics. 
    What started this wonderful movement was Professor Cox - albeit he had no had in the creation of this website. 
    Truth be told, this website serves as a sort of joke but there is a serious element to it. See, I believe that
    physicists are amazing at explaining the cosmos and getting people interested in physics! But, there seems to be
    this sort of dogma that haunts science much in the same way that fundamentalism tends to haunt religions. It is our (so far mine)
    goal to work towards defeating this sort of "science is magical!" or "it's all fact" nonsense. Some people may disagree with this - 
    and I welcome such discourse. Science is, after all, supposed to be self-correcting. But that is only if we actively work towards
    keeping that mechanism alive and functioning. Over the development of this website, I hope to create some material that may be
    beneifical to the popularization of physics and mathematics.</p>
